0.4.0

- Get the required input for mouse and controllers and create default input patterns.


KNOWN CORRECTIONS

- When using a new font, and it's height is weird, it's necesary to change its data on the TextNode class.
- When adding an input, you need to add it to the configs and the enum. 


KNOWN ERRORS

- If you try to initialize an entity with the wrong number of items, you will get a Write Access Violation or memory leak.
