KNOWN CORRECTIONS

- When using a new font, and it's height is weird, it's necesary to change its data on the TextNode class.
- When adding an input, you need to add it to the configs and the enum. 


KNOWN ERRORS

- Fullscreening acts weird, and I think there is a problem with windows and SFML compatibility.
- If you try to initialize an entity with the wrong number of items, you will get a Write Access Violation or memory leak.
